This folder contains all of my draft and final R scripts. 
The only two 'final' R codes are:

1. NEREOINCUBE_Combined_allR.R 
2. TaxaSummariesDESeq_Combo_NereoIncube.R

The rest are either exploratory or draft codes.

Some codes (like ALPHADIV and BETAPLOTS) are combined into the final codes (NEREOINCUBE_Combined_allR.R
Other codes (Enrichment_Nereoincube) are not used in the final analysis at all.
